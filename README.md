## Why this structure  

- A README (or `README.md`) is the de facto standard for documenting repositories — giving newcomers a quick orientation. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- It covers basic sections: project description, features, setup/installation, usage, contribution guidelines, license, contact — as recommended by best practices. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Providing directory structure helps others understand how files are organized, and aids maintenance or collaboration.  
- Clear setup instructions improve reproducibility for developers who want to run or extend the project.
